# Modules

Hand-maintained, one row per `MODULE.md`. Read this first; open a module's `MODULE.md` for the detail.

**Language: GDScript.** The host forces it — Godot 4.7.2 — so the repository skips the template's TypeScript and Effect parts. A module's interface is `interface.gd`, its errors are `errors.gd`, and public functions return an explicit result rather than raising: `{ ok: bool, value: Variant, error: Variant }`. Errors are values here for the same reason Effect makes them values elsewhere.

| Module | Purpose | Interface | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`testing`](testing/MODULE.md) | The harness, fixtures, and test doubles every other module's acceptance tests use | `testing/interface.gd` | — |
| [`review`](review/MODULE.md) | The packet an independent blind reviewer receives, and the acceptance contract it judges against | `review/interface.gd` | — |

2 module(s). The game's own modules are not yet named — they are decided on the wayfinder map, not invented here.
